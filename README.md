# Melbourn Housing Snapshot

This is my second Kaggle project that I tried in Kaggle. The goal of this project is to provide instruction in the field of Machine Learning. If you're interested in pursuing this course, you can access it through the following link: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)


Through the course, I conducted a analysis of Melbourne's real estate market using machine learning techniques. Following DanB's step-by-step guide, I acquired proficiency in a variety of machine learning concepts, including DecisionTreeRegressor, mean_absolute_error, train_test_split, and RandomForestRegressor.

To enhance the accuracy of house price predictions within Melbourne city, I harnessed the power of data with the help of pandas and scikit-learn libraries. This approach allowed me to create robust models for real estate price estimation.
