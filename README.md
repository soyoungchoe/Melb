# Melbourne Housing Snapshot

This is my second Kaggle project, and it's aimed at teaching Machine Learning to beginners. If you're interested in this course, you can access it through this link:  [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)

Instead of using the Iowa Housing data as per the course, I chose to work with Melbourne real estate data in Jupyter Notebook. I applied machine learning techniques to analyze Melbourne's real estate market. Following DanB's comprehensive guide, I gained proficiency in various machine learning concepts, such as DecisionTreeRegressor, mean_absolute_error, train_test_split, and RandomForestRegressor.

To improve the accuracy of house price predictions in Melbourne, I harnessed the power of data with the help of pandas and scikit-learn libraries. This approach allowed me to create robust models for estimating real estate prices in the city.

These are the main topics went over through out the course.
